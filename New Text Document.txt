# Real-time Scenario
- AWS Lambda Event based Trigger NOT working
- AWS Lambda NOT Getting Triggered

# Troubleshoot your AWS Lambda Issues, Steps:

## Check the correct AWS Event Bridge trgger properly configured mapped to the Lambda
- What happened in Lambda? AWS lambda triggers whatever it’s talking about either could be Cron based or, it could be Event based. In AWS EventBridge, there are multiple triggers. You need to make sure whether the proper trigger has been assigned to the lambda function. Otherwise, it will not trigger it On-time. Go to EventBridge > Events > Check Rules > EC2 instance tagged Lambda > Check EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) > Make sure your Lambda has been properly mapped with the correct EventBridge 

## Check the Event based trigger configured with proper JSON
- Check the respective EventBridge to see whether it is properly configured. Sometimes it would be wrongly configured with the JSON values. So that it should be validated. Go to EventBridge rules > Event pattern > Check “source”, “detail-type”: [“AWS API call via CloudTrail”], “detail”, “eventSource”, “eventName”: [“RunInstances”]. Lambda trigger runs based on a new agent created in CloudTrail.  
- Go to check CloudTrail > Event history > search bye ‘Event name’, ‘RunInstances’ 
- If required the edit the Event Pattern

## Check Lambda_handler 
- Check lambda_handler has been collecting data from the CloudTrail instance_id or NOT; because, sometimes, it takes code from Local source code
- If it is taking from Local then make sure there is NO Errors
- Now, Test Lambda function just to make sure NO Errors.

## Check Lambda CloudWatch log groups if any Errors or NOT
- go to Lambda Function > view logs in CloudWatch > Logs > Log groups > Log Streams 
- Check each log streams whether any Error or not

## Check Lambda Configuration settings are configured properly
- Go to lambda > Configuration > Check Triggers, Permissions, Destinations, Func URL, Env variables, Tags, VPC, Monitoring, Concurrency, invocation, code signing, database proxies

## Check CloudTrail is enabled in the same region with lambda
- Go to CloudTrail > Trails > Ctreate trail in the same region
